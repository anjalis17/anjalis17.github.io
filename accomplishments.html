      <strong> Won Teamwork Challenge Division 2nd Place Award at VEX Worlds 2019 (Louisville, KY)</strong>
      <p>
		After qualifying for Worlds for the first time, we were beyond ecstatic.
		Between State and Worlds, we worked for hours everyday in preparation for the higher-level competition, trying to rebuild our robot, increase the reliability of our autonomous program, and practice driving.
		We went in with no expectations other than to try our best, and were jumping up and down when we found out that we won second place in the tournament out of 80+ teams from across the globe.

      <h2><strong>Hosted Our First VEX IQ Summer Camp</strong></h2>
      <p>
        As our time in VEX IQ came to an end, we wanted to provide the next generation of VEX IQ competitiors a headstart to the competition season by teaching them some of the fundamentals behind robotics.
		We created lesson plans to conduct an in-person, hands-on summer camp focused on building/structural design, programming fundamentals, and basic STEM concepts like simple machines and forces.
		We charged every student a small fee, we were ultimately able to raise around $900 to help fund our first VRC season.

      <h2><strong>Won Excellence Award at VEX VRC WA State Championships 2020</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In our first year in VEX VRC, we were incredibly surprised and grateful to have won the Excellence Award at the WA State Tournament. The award qualified us to the 2020 VEX World Championships, which were unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19. More than anything, however, this tournament and the entirety of our first VRC season was an incredible learning experience for us. We went through countless obstacles and fought hard to overcome them, and we took everything we learned to become an even stronger team in our subsequent seasons.

      <h2><strong>Hosted Free Two-Week Online VEX IQ Summer Camp During COVID-19 Pandemic</strong></h2>
      <p>
        After seeing how much the kids enjoyed the previous year's summer camp and all that they were able to learn from it, we were motivated to conduct another summer camp even after the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
		We modified our curriculum to be able to teach a virtual camp, still targetted towards beginners and new VEX IQ competitors.
		We utilized SnapCAD to teach the basics of building and structural design, and taught programming through VEXcode VR.
		We also decided to make the summer camp free to give back to the robotics community and inspire more students to explore robotics.
		Since the camp was online, we were able to increase our student capacity and have broader community outreach.

      <h2><strong>Won Tourmament Champions at VEX VRC WA State Championships 2021</strong></h2>
      <p>
        After several build iterations and the hundreds of hours we poured into increasing the consistency of our autonomous program, we were proud to win Tournament Champions at the in-person WA State tournament.
		Both driving and our 15-second autonomous program were incredibly consistent, something which we had been eagerly trying to achieve throughout the season, but had never quite managed to get there.
		On the programming side, we thoroughly studied and integrated odometry and motion profiling to make this happen, and we will carry everything that we learned from this journey throughout the rest of our STEM careers.

        We couldn't believe we were selected as one of 10 teams among thousands at the 2021 Live Remote VEX World Championships to receieve the Excellence Award, giving us a golden ticket to VEX Worlds 2022 in Dallas, TX.
		Even though it was remote, the 3-day tournment was most definitely a fun and memorable experience--one that we'll always remember.

      <h2><strong>Hosted Free Two-Week VEX IQ In-Person Summer Camp & Created Synergy Robotics Club</strong></h2>
      <p>
        We were so glad to be able to host an in-person summer camp again! This time, our camp was targetted towards those interested in succeeding in VEX IQ competitively.
		We went into much more depth, covering more advanced CAD, structural design, and programming principles, as well as focusing more on hands-on building. We also taught students about the engineering design process
		and what constitutes a great engineering notebook. And most exciting of all, we started Synergy Robotics Club to take our outreach efforts a step forward and help teams be as successful as possible.
