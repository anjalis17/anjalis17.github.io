										<h2>What We Do</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Synergy Robotics Club is a club serving VEX IQ teams in the Greater Seattle Area. By mentoring each team all throughout the season, creating a community for teams to interact with one another, and providing teams with the parts/tools they need to succeed, we are helping VEX IQ competitors reach their full potential. </p>

												<h3>1. Mentorship & Team-Forming</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Our vision for all Synergy Robotics Club teams is for them to achieve success at highly competitive levels, while delving into the STEM fields and building life-long skills like teamwork and responsibility. Starting competitive robotics for the first time comes with a learning curve. Through our weekly mentorship program, in which we meet up with each team as often as once a week, we strive to help students overcome this learning curve, improve their robotics skillset, become stronger collaborators, and ultimately be as successful as they can be. Students who join our club without a preexisting team will be assisted to form a successful team that is an ideal match for them. <br> <br> 2021-2022 Mentorship Location: TBD (Redmond or Sammamish, WA) </p>

												<h3>2. VEX IQ Community</h3>
											</header>
											<p>From brainstorming designs and strategies to scrimmaging with one another in preparation for upcoming tournaments, teams have a network within which they can interact and collaborate when they join Synergy Robotics Club. Teams can exchange ideas and learn from each other, setting them up for success as they navigate competitive robotics. </p>

											<p>We will provide each team with a VEX IQ Superkit, the game field, and game elements. Additionally, we will register teams and cover the initial registration cost. Students are provided everything they need to succeed in VEX IQ; the only thing excluded from the package is competition registration costs, because each team will opt to attend different tournaments at their own discretion. </p>

										<h2>How Can I Join?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We are so excited that you're thinking of joining Synergy Robotics Club! Students can apply to Synergy Robotics Club as an individual looking for a team, or they can join with a preexisting team. If students are accepted, they become members of Synergy Robotics Club after paying the registration fee, which will range from around $250 to $400 (per team member), based on the number of applicants and how many teams are accepted into the program. Please note that Synergy Robotics is a nonprofit organization serving and giving back to the local community - in other words, 100% of the money collected will be used for team registration, as well as purchasing the VEX IQ kits, fields, and game elements that are given to each team to use throughout the entirety of the season. <br> <br>Apply using the link below by Friday, August 13, 2021!</p>
