									<p>When first entering the Vex community, we didn't know what to expect. Robotics was a new experience for all of us; we were fortunate enough to have a robotics club at Evergreen Middle School with a great teacher to set us on the right path. Under his guidance, we learned about important mechanisms in Vex, in addition to learning where to find resources to further facilitate our learning. With our newfound knowledge, we went to Youtube to learn from previous designs and how to build from them. In the beginning, our first competitive robot was somewhat cobbled-together, made from combining different mechanisms and structures from many other robots.</p>
									<p>As we progressed throughout the season, however, we were able to learn from our experiences - competitions, meetings, reveals - and thoroughly understand how to create a structurally sound, effective robot with a decent autonomous program. We felt accomplished at the end of the season, yet wished that we had more time to prepare as we felt we could have done better. The next season, we tried to begin meeting earlier in the season and create our own ideas for a robot that would fit the current challenge. Compared to last season, we had a much easier time. After more Vex seasons, we felt confident enough to help others avoid our slow first season, by offering a summer camp and an organization.</p>
									<p>We wanted to create an environment where those looking to enter Vex IQ or to improve could come together and quickly learn of crucial concepts, while sharing ideas with each other to mutually improve. We hope for all students to have a successful, fun robotics season! IDK REWRITE/EDIT</p>
