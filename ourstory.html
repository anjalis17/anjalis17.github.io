										<h1>Our Story</h1>

									<p>When we first joined the VEX community in middle school, we didn't know what to expect. Robotics was a new experience for all of us, and while we were excited to begin the journey, we had no idea where to begin nor what it entailed.
									   We were fortunate enough to have a robotics club at Evergreen Middle School composed of a strong and dedicated community of VEX IQ teams, as well as a wonderful teacher to set us on the right path. Under our teacher's guidance, we
									   learned about the process of competing, where we could find resources to facilitate our learning, and what we needed to do to get started. </p>
									<p>Our first couple competitive robots were somewhat cobbled-together, made from combining various basic mechanisms and structures that we had researched online. However, as the season progressed, we learned from the several competitions, scrimmages, and club meetings we attended,
									   observing other robots and analyzing the weaknesses in our own. It was a long process with many obstacles, but in the end, we came to thoroughly understand how to create a structurally sound, effective robot with a decent autonomous program. We ended up just barely making it to worlds that year,
									   but by applying what we learned and never giving up, we managed to win 2nd place in the teamwork challenge in our division of 80+ teams. It wasn't until later that we realized the importance of having that club as a support system- it gave us a collaborative environment in which we could interact with other teams
									   and helped us not only with logistics, but also with establishing a solid foundation.  </p>

									<p>The following season, we began VRC, the high-school level VEX robotics competition. As an independent, student-driven high school robotics team not associated with any organization, we were up against a very steep learning curve. We came across countless struggles and it took us months to get on par with the most competitive teams in our area, since we had little to no guidance from senior teams.
										However, from our experience in VEX IQ, we knew that learning would be a gradual process and that we would improve as we kept competing, identifying our strengths and weaknesses and iterating our robot design/autonomous.
										We were prepared for the learning curve and we never lost determination, which ultimately paid off.

									<p>After watching us compete over the years, many of our siblings and friends have taken an interest in competitive robotics, but most of them who attend schools without a robotics club have not been able to find a team or the resources they need to get started.  Thus, we decided to start Synergy Robotics Club. We believe that every new robotics competitor should have an opportunity to get the tools and guidance they need to begin their journey, so that they have a much higher chance at finding success, not just in VEX IQ, but beyond. Our hope is that together, teams can come together to exchange ideas, find inspiration, learn crucial concepts, get excited about the STEM fields, and mutually improve, in a fun, determined setting. </p>
